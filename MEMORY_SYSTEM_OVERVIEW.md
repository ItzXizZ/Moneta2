# Moneta Memory System: Comprehensive Overview

## üß† Introduction

The Moneta Memory System is an advanced AI memory architecture inspired by human memory formation, recall, and reinforcement patterns. Named after Moneta, the Roman goddess of memory, this system implements sophisticated cognitive principles to create a dynamic, self-improving memory network for AI applications.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### Human Memory Inspiration
The system is built on three fundamental principles observed in human cognition:

1. **Associative Memory Networks**: Memories are interconnected through semantic relationships
2. **Reinforcement Through Recall**: Frequently accessed memories become stronger over time
3. **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Memory recall is influenced by relevance and connection strength

### Design Goals
- **Semantic Understanding**: Go beyond keyword matching to understand meaning and context
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Memory strength adapts based on usage patterns
- **Network Intelligence**: Leverage connections between memories for enhanced recall
- **Scalable Performance**: Efficient algorithms that scale with memory volume

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Dual-Layer Design

#### 1. Full ML-Powered Memory Manager (`memory-app/backend/memory_manager.py`)
**Primary System** - Advanced AI-driven memory management

**Core Technologies:**
- **SentenceTransformers**: `all-mpnet-base-v2` model for semantic embeddings
- **Scikit-learn**: Cosine similarity calculations and TF-IDF vectorization
- **NumPy**: High-performance numerical operations
- **PyTorch**: Neural network backend for transformers

#### 2. Lightweight Memory Manager (`lightweight_memory_manager.py`)
**Fallback System** - Basic text-matching for resource-constrained environments

**Core Technologies:**
- **Regex Pattern Matching**: Word-based similarity calculations
- **JSON Storage**: Simple file-based persistence
- **Basic Scoring**: Word overlap and phrase matching algorithms

## üî¨ Memory Formation Process

### 1. Memory Creation
```python
def add_memory(self, content, tags=None, method='tfidf'):
    new_memory = {
        "id": f"mem_{uuid.uuid4()}",
        "content": content,
        "score": 0,  # Initial score
        "tags": tags or [],
        "created": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    }
```

**Process Flow:**
1. **Content Ingestion**: Raw text content is processed and assigned a unique ID
2. **Initial Scoring**: Memory starts with a base score of 0
3. **Embedding Generation**: SentenceTransformer creates semantic embeddings
4. **Index Building**: Memory is added to the searchable index
5. **Connection Analysis**: System calculates relationships with existing memories

### 2. Semantic Embedding
**Technology**: SentenceTransformers (`all-mpnet-base-v2`)
- **Vector Dimension**: 768-dimensional dense vectors
- **Semantic Capture**: Understands context, synonyms, and conceptual relationships
- **Language Understanding**: Trained on diverse text corpora for broad comprehension

## üï∏Ô∏è Connection Graph System

### Multi-Degree Connection Network

#### Connection Strength Thresholds
```python
# Similarity thresholds for connection quality
- 0.35-0.5: Weak but meaningful connection
- 0.5-0.7: Moderate connection  
- 0.7-0.85: Strong connection
- 0.85+: Very strong connection
```

#### Quality Filtering
**Content Length Adjustment**:
- **Short texts (‚â§3 words)**: Require similarity ‚â• 0.6 (higher threshold)
- **Medium texts (4-5 words)**: Require similarity ‚â• 0.45
- **Long texts (‚â•6 words)**: Standard threshold (0.35)

**Rationale**: Prevents false connections between generic short phrases

### Connection Graph Construction
```python
def _calculate_all_scores_and_connections(self, sim_threshold=0.35):
    # 1. Normalize embeddings for cosine similarity
    normalized_embeddings = normalize(self.search_embeddings, norm='l2')
    sim_matrix = normalized_embeddings @ normalized_embeddings.T
    
    # 2. Build bidirectional connections
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if similarity >= threshold:
                connections[i].append((j, similarity))
                connections[j].append((i, similarity))
```

---

## üéØ Memory Retrieval & Search

### Hybrid Search Algorithm

#### 1. Semantic Similarity Search
```python
def search_memories(self, query, top_k=10, min_relevance=0.2):
    # Generate query embedding
    query_embedding = self.st_model.encode([query])
    
    # Calculate similarities with all memories
    similarities = np.dot(self.search_embeddings, query_embedding.T).flatten()
    
    # Hybrid scoring: semantic + importance
    final_score = (similarity * 0.7) + (memory_score / 100 * 0.3)
```

#### 2. Scoring Components
**Semantic Relevance (70% weight)**:
- Cosine similarity between query and memory embeddings
- Captures conceptual and contextual relationships

**Memory Importance (30% weight)**:
- Historical reinforcement score
- Connection hub status (highly connected memories)
- Content quality indicators (length, detail)

### Quality Assurance
**Multi-Stage Filtering**:
1. **Relevance Threshold**: Minimum semantic similarity (configurable)
2. **Content Quality**: Prefer detailed, substantial memories
3. **Connection Strength**: Boost well-connected memories
4. **Recency Balance**: Consider both old and new memories

## üìà Dynamic Reinforcement System

### Inspiration: Hebbian Learning
*"Neurons that fire together, wire together"*

The reinforcement system implements a digital version of synaptic strengthening observed in biological neural networks.

### Multi-Degree Reinforcement
```python
def _reinforce_recalled_memories(self, recalled_memories):
    # 1. Direct reinforcement (100%)
    reinforcements[memory_id] += base_reinforcement
    
    # 2. First-degree neighbors (30%)
    neighbor_reinforcement = base_reinforcement * 0.3
    
    # 3. Second-degree neighbors (9% = 30% of 30%)
    second_degree_reinforcement = neighbor_reinforcement * 0.3
    
    # 4. Third-degree neighbors (2.7% = 30% of 9%)
    third_degree_reinforcement = second_degree_reinforcement * 0.3
```

### Reinforcement Principles

#### 1. **Direct Strengthening**
- Recalled memories receive full reinforcement boost
- Strength proportional to retrieval relevance score
- Simulates synaptic potentiation in biological memory

#### 2. **Associative Strengthening**
- Connected memories receive partial reinforcement
- Implements "spreading activation" from cognitive science
- Strengthens memory networks, not just individual memories

#### 3. **Decay Prevention**
- Regular recall prevents memory degradation
- Unused connections may weaken over time (future enhancement)
- Mirrors biological "use it or lose it" principle

### Reinforcement Cascade
```
Query: "machine learning algorithms"

Direct Match: "Neural networks are powerful ML algorithms" (+1.0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1st Degree: "Deep learning applications" (+0.3)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2nd Degree: "Computer vision projects" (+0.09)
